overview: >-
  Effective accelerationism is a political theory that seeks to accelerate the
  collapse of capitalism and usher in a new era of radical change. It is based
  on the idea that capitalism is inherently self-destructive and that by
  speeding up its destructive tendencies, we can hasten its demise and bring
  about a more just and egalitarian society.


  The origins of effective accelerationism can be traced back to the works of
  philosophers and theorists such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, and Gilles
  Deleuze. Friedrich Nietzsche believed that the collapse of existing systems
  and values was necessary for the emergence of a new and better society. Karl
  Marx also argued that capitalism contained within itself the seeds of its own
  destruction, and that it was the task of the working class to accelerate this
  process through revolution. Gilles Deleuze expanded on these ideas and
  proposed the concept of "deterritorialization," which refers to the
  dismantling of oppressive structures and institutions.


  Effective accelerationism rejects the idea of gradual reform within the
  existing system and instead advocates for a radical and rapid transformation.
  One of the key strategies of effective accelerationism is to embrace and
  amplify the negative aspects of capitalism, such as exploitation, inequality,
  and environmental destruction. By pushing these tendencies to their extreme,
  it is believed that the system will eventually collapse under its
