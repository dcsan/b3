overview: >-
  Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on
  creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require
  human intelligence. These machines are programmed to think, learn, and adapt,
  allowing them to perform complex tasks that would otherwise require human
  intervention. AI is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to
  revolutionize the way we live and work.


  At its core, AI is based on the concept of creating intelligent agents that
  can perceive their environment and take actions to maximize their chances of
  success. This is achieved through the use of algorithms and data, which allow
  machines to make decisions and learn from experience. One of the key
  components of AI is machine learning, which involves training machines to
  recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on that information.
  This allows machines to improve their performance over time and adapt to new
  situations.


  There are several different types of AI, each with its own set of capabilities
  and limitations. Some examples include symbolic AI, which uses logic and rules
  to solve problems, and deep learning, which uses neural networks to process
  large amounts of data and make decisions. AI has a wide range of applications,
  from speech recognition and natural language processing to self-driving cars
  and medical diagnosis. As technology advances, the potential uses for AI
  continue to grow, making
